Spark-in-IaaS-QingCloud
=======================

Script to deploy HDFS, Mesos and Spark in public cloud QingCloud

To use:
1. Create a QingCloud accout (https://www.qingcloud.com/)
2. Follow my blog to create Mesos master and slave image templates
3. Start an instance with master image template. Associate a public IP with the instance
4. Modify the script with necessary credentials
5. Run the script

It might be difficult to run as is. So this script gives a basic idea of auto-spawning public cloud instances and modifying configs. This should be the most important thing :--)
